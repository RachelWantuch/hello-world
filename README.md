Repository practice for Assignment 1-1

My name is Rachel. I work at Disneyland for now. 
Hopefully this BS-GIST Degree from UofA will get me help me get into the GIS career path though.
I am slowly turning my truck into an overlander for longer adventures.
I enjoy hiking, the beach, craft beer, and working out at the gym.
